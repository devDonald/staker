This is a simple Stock NFT. A company can choose to use this platform to give out ownership of the company to the general public. Percentages greater than 10 have voting rights associated with them and can be used in making decisions for the company. If a person chooses to sell his shares, it would be returned back to the marketplace but the owner would retain ownership until another person chooses to buy those shares. This ensures continuity of the business and ensures that the business is truly decentralized and for the people. The admin is in charge of minting/adding new shares
